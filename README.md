# FPV-ROBOT-CAR
First-Person View (FPV) robot car powered by the Xiao ESP32S3 Sense microcontroller. The project combines the power of ESP32S3's AI capabilities with real-time video streaming, enabling a fully immersive FPV experience.

Just upload the code then copy the IP address from you serial monitor and paste it to your browser and enjoy the FPV experience. Ensure you are connected to the "robotcar" network. The password is "robotcar", you can modify it in the code as you like.


# FPV Robot Car Powered by Xiao ESP32S3 Sense

## Overview

This project brings to life a childhood fascination with robot cars equipped with cameras, transforming it into a fully functional FPV (First-Person View) robot car. Powered by the Xiao ESP32S3 Sense, this robot car is capable of real-time video streaming and remote control via a web-based interface accessible from any device on your local network. The web app allows you to steer the car, navigate obstacles, and even control an onboard LED, all while watching a live video feed from the car's camera.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Video Streaming**: View live footage from the car's camera directly in the web app.
- **Remote Control**: Steer the car in any direction, move forward or backward, and stop it at any time using the web interface.
- **Onboard LED Control**: Turn the car's LED light on or off remotely.
- **Web-Based Interface**: Accessible from any device on your local network, making control simple and intuitive.

### Components

- **Xiao ESP32S3 Sense**: The heart of the project, chosen for its powerful processing capabilities, integrated Wi-Fi, and compact size.
- **Custom 4-Wheel Robot Car**: The platform for the project, providing mobility and a sturdy base for the electronics.
- **L298N Motor Driver**: Responsible for controlling the motors and providing the necessary power to drive the car.
- **LED**: An onboard light that can be toggled on or off via the web app.
- **Female-to-Female Jumper Wires & Antenna**: For connecting components and ensuring a stable Wi-Fi connection.

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, you’ll need the following:
